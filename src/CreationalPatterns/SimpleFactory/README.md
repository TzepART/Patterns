## Description

### In short:
A simple factory simply generates an instance for the client without providing any instance logic.

### When to use?
When creating an object involves some kind of logic, and not just a few assignments. 
It makes sense to delegate the task to a dedicated factory rather than repeating the same code everywhere.
