Creational patterns
======================
*Creational patterns describe the creation (instantiate) of an object or group of related objects. Or in other words, 
patterns that use the mechanisms of creating objects to create objects suitable for this situation. The basic way of 
creating can lead to problems in the architecture or to its complication. Creational patterns try to solve these 
problems by controlling how objects are created.*
