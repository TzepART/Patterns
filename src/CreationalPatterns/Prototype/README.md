## Description

Summarily

An object is created by cloning an existing object.
Or in other words, the "Prototype" Template is used when the types of objects being created are defined by the prototype instance,
cloned to create new objects.

When to use it?

When the required object is similar to an existing one, or when creating it from scratch is more expensive than cloning.

In PHP, you can use __clone
