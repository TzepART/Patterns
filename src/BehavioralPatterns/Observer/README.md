## Description

Summarily
The template defines a dependency between objects so that when the state of one of them changes
his "subordinates" found out about it.
Or
In the "Observer" template, there is an object ("subject") that maintains a list of its "subordinates" ("observers") and
automatically notifies them of any change in their state, usually by calling one of their methods.
