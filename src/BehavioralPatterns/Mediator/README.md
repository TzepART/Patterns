## Description

Summarily

The "Intermediary" template implies adding a third-party object ("intermediary") for management
interaction between two objects ("colleagues"). The template helps reduce the coupling of classes,
communicating with each other, because now they do not need to know about the implementations of their interlocutors.

Or

A template defines an object that encapsulates the way a set of objects interact.
