## Description

Summarily
The template allows you to change the behavior of the class when the state changes.
Or
The State template implements the state machine in an object-oriented way. This is achieved by:
 - implementations of each state as a derived class of the "State" template interface,
 - implement state transitions by calling methods defined by a higher class (superclass).

The "State" template is in some sense a "Strategy" template, where you can switch the current strategy
by calling methods defined in the template interface.
