## Description

Summarily
The chain of responsibility template allows you to create chains of objects. The request is entered from one end of the chain and
moves from object to object until a suitable handler is found.
Or
The chain of responsibility template contains the source control object and a number of processing objects.
Each processing object contains logic that defines the types of command objects that it can
process, and the rest are passed along the chain to the next processing object.
