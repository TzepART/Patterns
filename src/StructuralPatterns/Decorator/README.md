Summarily

The Decorator template allows you to dynamically change the behavior of an object at runtime,
wrapping it in an object of the "decorator" class.

Or

The "Decorator" template allows you to connect additional behavior to an object (statically or dynamically),
without affecting the behavior of other objects of the same class. The template is often used to observe the principle
