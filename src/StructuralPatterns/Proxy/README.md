## Description

Summarily
Using the 'Proxy' template, a class represents the functionality of another class.

Or

In its most General form, a 'proxy' is a class that functions as an interface to something.
This is a shell or agent object called by the client to access another 'real' object.

The 'Proxy' can simply forward requests to the real object, or it can provide
additional logic: data caching for intensive operations or consumption
this object; checking preconditions before calling execution
operations with a real object.
